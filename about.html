        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p> We are a passionate team dedicated to developing innovative solutions that enhance road safety and reduce accidents. Our project, <strong>U-Turn Accident Prevention System</strong>, focuses on making U-turns safer for drivers by utilizing smart technology to provide real-time guidance and alerts, ensuring a seamless and secure driving experience.
        </p>
        <h3>What We Are Doing</h3>
        <p>
            Our primary goal is to minimize accidents caused during U-turns by creating an intelligent traffic control system. This system uses advanced sensors and dynamic traffic signals to provide accurate guidance to drivers, ensuring safe decision-making during U-turns.  
        </p>
        <h3>We aim to achieve this by: </h3>
        <p> - Detecting Vehicle Movements: Monitoring vehicle speed and proximity on both sides of the road.<br>  
            - Dynamic Signaling: Adjusting traffic light signals (Green, Yellow, Red) in real-time based on vehicle activity.<br>
            - Enhancing Road Awareness: Providing visual cues that help drivers make informed decisions.  
            </p>
        <h3>How We Are Doing It</h3>
        <p>We use cutting-edge technologies to build a robust system:<br>  
            1. Sensors:<br>  
               - Proximity Sensors: To detect approaching vehicles and their distance.<br>
               - Speed Sensors: To measure the speed of vehicles on both sides of the U-turn.<br> 
            2. Control System:<br>  
               - Analyzes the sensor data in real-time to determine appropriate signal changes.<br>  
            3. Traffic Lights:<br>  
               - Dynamic lights (Green, Yellow, Red) guide drivers on when to proceed or stop.<br> 
            4. Software Interface:<br>  
               - A centralized system that integrates the hardware and processes data for decision-making.
            </p>
        <h3>How It Is Helpful</h3>  
        <p>Our system addresses critical road safety challenges: <br> 
            - Accident Prevention: Reduces the risk of collisions during U-turns by providing clear, real-time guidance to drivers. <br> 
            - Improved Traffic Flow: Prevents unnecessary stops and delays, ensuring smoother traffic movement.  <br>
            - Increased Driver Confidence: Provides a reliable system that helps drivers make safe decisions. <br> 
            - Data-Driven Insights: Collects and analyzes traffic data to improve road safety planning. </p>
        <h3>How It Is Useful</h3> 
        <p>- For Drivers:  <br>  
            - Offers a clear understanding of when it is safe to take a U-turn.<br>  
            - Reduces stress and confusion in high-traffic or low-visibility areas.<br> 
           -For Authorities:<br> 
            - Enables better traffic management.<br> 
            - Promotes safer infrastructure design based on collected data.<br> 
           -For Society:   <br> 
            - Lowers accident rates, saving lives and reducing medical costs.<br> 
            - Contributes to more disciplined driving behavior.<br>
